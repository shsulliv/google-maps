# google-maps
Simple map app that calculates a trip to Google London

## Instructions
Create a webpage that uses the Google Maps JavaScript API to show a route from the user's current
location to another fixed location (which could be anywhere: your favorite restaurant, Buckingham Palace, Google London, etc.)
* Allow the user to switch between walking route, driving route, and public transportation
* Bonus points for making it responsive and work well on small screens (phone, tablets) and with touch interactions
